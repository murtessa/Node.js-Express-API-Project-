The above project is a simple Express.js application designed to manage a collection of blog posts through RESTful API endpoints. 
It utilizes Express.js for server creation and routing, enabling key functionalities such as retrieving a list of posts (GET /posts), 
fetching an individual post by ID (GET /posts/:id),
creating a new post (POST /posts), updating an existing post (PUT /posts/:id), and deleting posts (DELETE /posts and DELETE /posts/:id).
The project employs in-memory storage for blog post data, allowing users to interact with the API through HTTP requests.
